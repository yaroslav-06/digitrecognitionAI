# digitrecognitionAI

A backtracking neural network built from scratch in C++, for MNIST digit recognition.\
Inspired by 3Blue1Brown video series about Neural networks on MNIST.\
And further improved with Convoluted Neural Networks. 

To run the code clone, and open directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/yaroslav-06/digitrecognitionAI.git
cd digitrecognitionAI/mnist_dts_ai/code
```
And then run (should install c++ compiler first):
```
g++ -O3 -std=c++17 -o .task *.cpp AI/*.cpp imageProcessing/*.cpp && ./.task
```
